# suicide-data-analysis

One of the major public health problems that has enormous emotional, social, and economic consequences is suicide. Suicide is a deliberate act of ending your own life. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 703,000 people take their lives and there are many more who attempt suicide every year.
There are some notions that suicide occurs in high-income countries but in fact, it’s a global phenomenon and over 77% of global suicides were recorded in low and middle-income countries in 2019 (WHO). Suicides are preventable and society should never stigmatize speaking out and mental wellness.
World Health Organization (WHO) has dedicated September 10th as World Suicide Prevention Day. The aim is to focus the attention of the world on the issue of suicide, reduce stigma, and raise awareness globally that suicides are preventable. To celebrate the 2023 world suicide prevention day, I analyzed the suicide dataset by WHO spanning from 1950 to 2020 (see dataset here [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumaranand05/who-suicide-data-1950-2021].
In this project, I analyzed the dataset to answer the following questions:
              How does suicide incidence vary by gender?
              How does suicide incidence vary by age group?
              Are there any significant differences in suicide rates among different countries or regions?
              What are the top 10 countries with the highest suicide incidence?
              How many countries are in this dataset?
              How many years of data do we have?
              What are the total deaths by suicide recorded in this dataset during this period?
              What’s the yearly suicide trend?

My findings show that:
A total of 118 countries were recorded in this dataset for a period of 71 years (1950 – 2020). The total number of deaths recorded due to suicide from 1950 to 2020 was 11,491,746. Out of this number, female deaths were 2,898,889 which is 25%. Male deaths were at a staggering 8,592,545 which is 75% of total deaths.
Europe was responsible for most of the suicide occurrences with total death of 5,457,572. They are followed by Asia with a total death of 2,578,947. Closely following Asia is North America and the Caribbean with total suicide death of 2,348,773. Oceania has suicide deaths of 160,931 while Africa has the lowest suicide deaths of 17,231.
People between the ages of 45-49 years committed the highest number of suicides with a total death of 1,034,775 closely followed by the age group 50-54 with total death of 1,024,626. Age group 0 has the lowest suicide deaths with a total number of 3.
The top countries with the highest suicide incidence over the past 71 years are:
              United States of America – 2,044,787 deaths
              Russia Federation – 1,586,056 deaths
              Japan – 1,568,917
              France – 640,219
              Ukraine – 385,164
              United Kingdom – 340,411
              Germany – 338,037
              Republic of Korea – 329,086
              Brazil – 316,008
              Poland – 267,246
The yearly trend showed suicide death steadily increasing from 1950 to 1979 with a sudden increase from 1980 to 1982. There was a decrease in suicide deaths in 1983 and 1984. From 1988 the suicide deaths resumed an upward trend with the highest suicide recorded in 2002 with a total of 260,762 suicide deaths. Suicide death has been on a downward trend from 2002 to 2020.

Some of the prevention and control methods outlined by WHO in suicide prevention and control include:
              Limiting access to means of suicide like firearms, pesticides, certain medications
              Early identification, assessment, and management of people with suicidal behaviors
              Interact with the media for responsible reporting of suicide
              Encourage socio-economic life skills in adolescents
In the spirit of suicide prevention awareness, let us normalize the habit of speaking out and taking mental health seriously. We should keep showing love and empathy to everyone because you can never tell what that person is going through. Suicide prevention requires the effort of all of us, the government, the private sector, and the public sector. Let us all join hands to kick this menace out of our society.
